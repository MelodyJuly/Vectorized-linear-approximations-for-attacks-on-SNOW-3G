# Vectorized-linear-approximations-for-attacks-on-SNOW-3G
The noise distribution for the paper "Vectorized linear approximations for attacks on SNOW 3G" in FSE 2020

The distribution table is of size 2^24, each holding the probability of occurences of i, for i from 0 to 2^24 -1.

The test.c file give the code about how to read the distribution and calculate the bias.
